# FreeCodeCampContribution  
This repository contains my contribution to FreeCodeCamp's Arabic Translation project.  
### 1- Project Metrics using Python:  
In this py snippet, I have participated with providing the code to track the project's progress in real time.  
The code fetches the data from the project's online GSheet and orders each contributor's (translator) progress status,  
There are 2 DataFrames as an output, the first is raw data, the second is final_df where each translator is captured once  
in the dataframe and her/his assignments' count, completes tasks, and percentage of these completed tasks to the overall completion of the whole project.  
A final Dictionary {overall} is thrown in order to giver some global progress status on the project as a whole.  

### 2- Translations:  
This folder contains:  
a- all .md files which are my translation from English to Arabic for all the articles I decided to translate.  
b- The folder ***Live Articles Links*** contains a .txt file with all my translations live on the FreeCodeCamp's page,  
For each article, please search for the phrase, *"تمت الترجمة بواسطة Tamer Saleh"*, which means, ***Translated By: Tamer Saleh***
